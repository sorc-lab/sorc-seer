java ConvertSeconds < test.in > test.out
java ConvertSeconds 193.04
diff *.out *.exp
cmp -b *.out *.exp

test.out test.exp differ: byte 61, line 1 is  40    12 ^J

Better way:
hexdump -C file1 > file1.hex
hexdump -C file2 > file2.hex
diff file1.hex file2.hex

Shows nothing in diff... exactly the same, but cmp -b
command was indicating that there was possibly a different
line ending character.
