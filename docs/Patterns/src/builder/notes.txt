(While writing unit tests)

GoF shows a much more complex Builder pattern (pg.97).
Didn't read the whole spec., but it uses an interface for building complex
mazes. It uses object(s) and multiple 'builders' that each build the obj. in a
different way.

Should be looked at closer when implementing 'Procedural Generation of Modular
Formats' algorithms.
