(Only use when needed to make a clone of an object instead of needing a new
instance)

Create objects based on a template of an existing object through cloning.

**
Instead of going to the trouble of creating object from scratch every time, you
can make copies of an original instance and modify it as required.

'Prototype' interface declares a method for cloning itself, while the
'ConcretePrototype' implements the operation for cloning itself.

Should be used when composition, create and representation of objects should be
decoupled from the system. Or, classes to be created are specified at runetime,
or you need to hide the complexity of creating new instance from the client, or
creating an object is an expensive operation and it would be more efficient to
copy an object, or objects are required that are similar to existing objects.

NOTE: Many have said that using Java's built-in Cloneable interface is broken
      and not considered good to use. Need to look deeper into this. The
      pattern is good, but Java's built-in implementation is wrong and a custom
      solution needs to be created here.
      
*** I may have mitigated the above note by implementing my own clone() method
    in the Shape class. I also do not see how this is a problem since I am just
    using clone to make a copy of the stored object. This seems to be perfectly
    legal since it does exactly what the patterns suggests. In the case of
    shapes, I load shapes into a cache/DB and when I call the 'getter' function,
    it returns a CLONED copy of what is actually stored, thus decoupling that
    object from the system's STORED object.
