Deal five or more cards to each player, and then deal one card face up to
create the “discard pile”. Place the remaining cards face down to create the
“draw pile”.

Each player takes turns placing a single card on the discard pile. The card
must match the rank or suit of the previously played card, or be an eight,
which is a “wild card”.

When players don’t have a matching card or an eight, they must draw new cards
until they get one.

If the draw pile ever runs out, the discard pile is shuffled (except the top
card) and becomes the new draw pile.

As soon as a player has no cards, the game ends and all other players score
penalty points for their remaining cards. Eights are worth 20, face cards are
worth 10, and all others are worth their rank.
